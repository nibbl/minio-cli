**Minio-client**

CLI utility for downloading, uploading, and listing files in S3 buckets

You can override default values with command-line arguments. Highly recommend using venv for avoiding problems with system packages

**P.S.**
I wrote that utility for self-use in just a couple of hours,
but realize that utility will be useless because [mc](https://github.com/minio/mc)
already has all required functions.
